`set -o pipefail` — a Bash command that stops errors hiding in pipes. This blog does the same for your digital rights.

pipefail is for those who believe privacy is a right, not a privilege. If you’re here, you’ve felt it — the slow crawl of control as your phone, messages, and data slip from your hands.

I’m writing about that.

From the UK quietly gutting encryption, to the tired lie of “if you’ve got nothing to hide,” this place cuts through the noise. I’m not here to be polite. I’m here to call it like it is. Before it’s too late.

We’re tracking the UK’s war on end-to-end encryption, secret backdoor warrants you’ll never hear about, and the creeping normalization of client-side scanning that turns your device into a snitch.

Paranoid? Good. That means you’re awake.

Fortnightly dispatches. Clear, honest breakdowns of legislation, tech, surveillance, and what you can do about it. Mostly pissed off, sometimes hopeful, always honest.

Privacy isn’t a setting you tick off in a menu — it’s the bedrock of freedom in a world that wants control. They don’t want your data. They want your obedience. pipefail exists to make disobedience possible.

About me? UK-based, UK-focused, pro-encryption, allergic to surveillance creep (and pineapple). A pseudonymous technologist who’d rather have sovereignty than convenience.

No newsletters. No trackers. Just your RSS reader and a thirst for truth.

Encrypt everything. Assume nothing.
