Thanks for stopping by.

If you’re here, it means you’re paying attention — to what’s happening to our privacy, our rights, and the technology we depend on. The UK’s digital landscape is shifting fast, and not in a good way.

pipefail is my attempt to cut through the noise and give you clear, no-nonsense updates on what really matters. Expect deep dives on encryption, surveillance laws, and the tech that shapes our freedoms.

The first proper post will tackle the UK’s current assault on end-to-end encryption — one of the biggest threats to our digital sovereignty right now. I’ll break down what’s at stake, what the government wants, and what it means for you.

No newsletters. No tracking. Just open your favourite RSS reader and subscribe.

If you want to verify that it’s really me writing, my PGP key is [here.](/pgp/)

Because privacy isn’t just a tech issue — it’s a fight for freedom.

So stick around, ask questions, stay sharp.

See you in the next dispatch.
