What started as satire is now statute.  
Age verification is here.

And with it, the slow dismantling of anonymous access. The creeping criminalisation of pseudonymity. The birth of a system where identity is the price of entry.

As of this month, if you can’t **(or won’t)** verify your age, your access is revoked.

Welcome to the age of "safety".  
Where freedom is filtered.  
And speech must show its papers.  

## The Age Checks Arrive

The Online Safety Act makes age assurance mandatory for platforms that *could* host anything “harmful to children.”

That doesn’t **just** mean porn.

It means anything that *might* be “inappropriate.”  
The scope? Vague by design.  
The enforcement? Delegated to tech companies.  

    Tick here to confirm you’re over 18?  

That won’t cut it anymore.

They want ID.  
Face scans.  
Behavioural data.  
Third-party verification.

It’s a surveillance stack sold as child protection.

Today: Pornhub, OnlyFans.  
Tomorrow: forums, subreddits, private messages, satire sites, art, dissent.

**Even this blog.**

The government doesn’t build the dragnet - it outsources it.  
“You do the checks, or you get the fines.”

## Safety as Subterfuge

Let’s be real: **no one’s** saying kids should roam the darkest corners of the internet.

But this? This isn’t protection. It’s projection.  
It’s exploiting fear to normalise control.

“Think of the children” becomes a bludgeon.  
Resist? You’re suspect.  
Refuse? You must be hiding something.  

By building the infrastructure now, under the most defensible pretext, they make it easy to expand later.

What starts as porn control becomes access control.

Memes.  
News.  
Criticism.  
Jokes.  
Culture.  

All subject to age-gating.  
All filtered through compliance APIs.  
All quietly de-risked.  

## Category 1, Category Done

The Act introduces platform categories - and Category 1 is the kill zone.

Big platforms.  
Big reach.  
Big speech.  

If people organise there, argue there, meme there?  
It’s probably Category 1.

These platforms must:

- Verify age
- Remove flagged content
- Moderate “legal but harmful” speech
- Offer user verification (with perks for verified users)

### What defines Category 1?
That’s up to OFCOM. Case-by-case. Opaque. Arbitrary.

And that’s the point.

Platforms are incentivised to pre-comply, pre-censor, preempt.

Better to neuter yourself than roll the dice.

It’s compliance through paranoia.

## Parenting via Proxy

If this were really about protecting children, the government would be empowering parents - not outsourcing parenting to platforms and scanning your face to prove you’re not a kid.

But this isn’t about trust.  
It’s about totality.  

You are presumed a child — until proven otherwise.  
Even if you’re 35.  
Even if you’re 70.  

Every site bends around the assumption that everyone’s a minor unless they submit state-approved proof.

It’s not “think of the children.”  
It’s “prove you’re not one.”

And now, platforms redesign themselves to serve regulators - not users.

Parental judgement is out.  
Biometric compliance is in.  

## Compliance or Censorship
The Act doesn’t just demand moderation - it mandates surveillance by design.

Section 136 forces platforms to proactively detect “harmful” or illegal content.

That means:

- Hash-matching
- Machine learning
- AI scanning

Even in **private** DMs

This is client-side scanning, warmed over.  
It’s Apple’s shelved system - now resurrected through legislation.

Even encrypted platforms aren’t safe.  
If you don’t compromise privacy, you’re in breach.

Refuse to comply?  
Massive fines.  
Criminal liability.  
Banned from the app store.  

The message is clear:  
Respect privacy, and we’ll destroy you.

## Identity as the Price of Entry
I joked:  
> “You must be 18 or older to read this sentence…”

It used to be a joke.  
Now it’s law.

We’ve passed through the gates - silently, obediently - into a world where the login screen is a checkpoint, and the cost of entry is your identity.

“Papers, please” isn’t fiction anymore.  
It’s digital reality.

No verified ID?  
No access.  
No voice.  
No rights.

This has all happened before:

- Soviet passports
- Nazi ID cards
- Apartheid passbooks

When identity becomes a precondition for participation, dissent becomes a crime.

Every post is traceable.  
Every joke is evidence.  
Every disagreement is a liability.

This isn’t safety.  
It’s selective permission.

We aren’t regulating the internet.  
We’re rebuilding it in the image of the state.

Anonymity is not a loophole.  
It’s liberty.  
Lose it, and the internet is no longer open — it’s a cage.

And now the final question:

## What can we do?

Sovereignty isn’t a thought experiment - it’s a daily discipline.

Start here:

- Ditch government ID-based platforms.  
Favour pseudonymous, decentralised, and self-hosted alternatives.

- Use privacy-first tools.  
Switch to Signal, Mullvad, Proton, GrapheneOS, and encrypted email.  
Avoid Big Tech clouds.

- Self-host when you can.  
Especially for communications, documents, DNS, and backups.

- Get involved.  
Support digital rights orgs like Open Rights Group, Big Brother Watch, and AWO.

- Stay aware.   
Read bills.   
Watch for “consultations.”  
Be early to raise hell.
 
This isn’t paranoia. It’s preparation.  
Feeling uneasy about the world right now? Good.  
That’s your instinct doing its job.

Resilience isn’t about fear. It’s about love - for your future, your family, your freedom.

Start small. Start local. Start now.
